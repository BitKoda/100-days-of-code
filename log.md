### Day 0: January 01, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

1. Set up a Medium account (@8-bit-koda) to write about my coding experiences
2. Set up a Twitter account (@8_koda) to make my commitment to the 100daysofcode challenge public
3. Set up this Github account to keep all of my code
4. Got a FreeCodeCamp account to start the journey
5. Completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 FreeCodeCamp challenges!

**Thoughts:** Github has changed since I last used it! Excited to begin this journey into a new career.

### Day 1: January 02, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

1. Completed the Basic CSS FreeCodeCamp challenges!

**Thoughts:** To make some of the more advanced CSS styling concepts stick I need to create some Anki cards and take a deeper dive into both HTML and CSS.

**TODO:** Purchase a book on HTML and CSS, maybe [Head First HTML and CSS](https://amzn.to/2X2UJf1) as recommended by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs)? Published in 2012, could this be out of date?

### Day 2: January 03, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

1. Completed the Applied Visual Design FreeCodeCamp challenges!

**Thoughts:** As per yesterday - must create those Anki cards and get a good book on both HTML and CSS. I'm thinking of [Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS - Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/product/responsive-web-design-with-html5-and-css-third-edition/9781839211560). 

**TODO:** Purchase a book on HTML and CSS (or a video course?)
