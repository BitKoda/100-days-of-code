# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Link to FreeCodeCamp work:** [FreeCodeCamp Profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/bitkoda)

### Day 0(1): January 01, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

1. Set up a Medium account (@8-bit-koda) to write about my coding experiences
2. Set up a Twitter account (@8_koda) to make my commitment to the 100daysofcode challenge public
3. Set up this Github account to keep all of my code
4. Got a FreeCodeCamp account to start the journey
5. Completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 FreeCodeCamp challenges!

**Thoughts:** Github has changed since I last used it! Excited to begin this journey into a new career. 

**TODO**
1. Start FreeCodeCamp!

### Day 1(2): January 02, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

1. Completed the Basic CSS FreeCodeCamp challenges!

**Thoughts:** To make some of the more advanced CSS styling concepts stick I need to create some Anki cards and take a deeper dive into both HTML and CSS.

**TODO:** 
~~1. Purchase a book on HTML and CSS, maybe [Head First HTML and CSS](https://amzn.to/2X2UJf1) as recommended by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs)? Published in 2012, could this be out of date?~~ 

### Day 2(3): January 03, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

1. Completed the Applied Visual Design FreeCodeCamp challenges!

**Thoughts:** As per yesterday - must create those Anki cards and get a good book on both HTML and CSS. I'm thinking of [Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS - Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/product/responsive-web-design-with-html5-and-css-third-edition/9781839211560). 

**TODO:** 
~~1. Purchase a book on HTML and CSS (or a video course?)~~ 

### Day 3(4): January 04, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

1. Finished Applied Accessibility, and 
2. Responsive Design Principles on #freeCodeCamp, and 
3. Started to use the pomodoro technique to time my work and break sessions using [pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io/)

**Thoughts:** It feels like I am going too quickly through the FCC challenges for HTML and CSS. I am therefore going to complete the CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid on days 4(5) and 5(6), and then go back and read over the material again and add important information to some Anki slide decks. Once I have done this, I will read through [Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS](https://www.packtpub.com/product/responsive-web-design-with-html5-and-css-third-edition/9781839211560) (completing any exercises therein) before going on to complete the HTML and CSS Responsive Web Design Projects.

**TODO:**
~~1. Complete FCC CSS Flexbox~~

**TODONE:** 
1. Bought a subscription at Packt Press for access to books and videos on web development. :heavy_check_mark:
2. FCC Applied Accessibility
3. FCC Resonsive Web Design Prinsiples

### Day 4(5): January 05, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

1. Finished FCC CSS Flexbox challenges!

**Thoughts:** Although the exercises were simple to follow, thanks to step-by-step instructions, the concept of flexbox will take much more to fully understand it and embed into my brain. Looking forward to starting (maybe even completing) the CSS Grid challenges tomorrow and then it will be time to go back and review, write anki decks before moving on to the HTML/CSS book. Only once I have done this will I feel able to tackle the HTML and CSS projects on FCC. 

**TODO:**
~~1. Complete FCC CSS Grid

**TODONE:** 
1. FCC CSS Flexbox

### Day 5(6): January 06, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

1. Finished FCC CSS Grid challenges!

**Thoughts:** This was definitely more of a challenge than Flexbox. Some revision required here! Getting used to the syntax will take a little time. 

**TODO:**
1. Revise all FCC HTML and CSS challenges
~~2. Start reading [Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS](https://www.packtpub.com/product/responsive-web-design-with-html5-and-css-third-edition/9781839211560)

**TODONE:** 
~~1. FCC CSS Grid

### Day 6(7): January 07, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

1. Read (and coded along) https://bit.ly/2MJqUOM by @benfrain to chapter 1 and (a third of) chapter 2.

**Thoughts:** This was definitely more of a challenge than Flexbox. Some revision required here! Getting used to the syntax will take a little time. 

**TODO:**
1. Revise all FCC HTML and CSS challenges
2. Finish chapter 2 of book.

**TODONE:** 
1. Chapter 1 Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS
