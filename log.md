### Day 1(2): January 02, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

1. Completed the Basic CSS FreeCodeCamp challenges!

**Thoughts:** To make some of the more advanced CSS styling concepts stick I need to create some Anki cards and take a deeper dive into both HTML and CSS.

**TODO:** 
1. Purchase a book on HTML and CSS, maybe [Head First HTML and CSS](https://amzn.to/2X2UJf1) as recommended by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs)? Published in 2012, could this be out of date?

### Day 2(3): January 03, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

1. Completed the Applied Visual Design FreeCodeCamp challenges!

**Thoughts:** As per yesterday - must create those Anki cards and get a good book on both HTML and CSS. I'm thinking of [Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS - Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/product/responsive-web-design-with-html5-and-css-third-edition/9781839211560). 

**TODO:** 
1. Purchase a book on HTML and CSS (or a video course?)

### Day 3(4): January 04, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

1. Finished Applied Accessibility, and 
2. Responsive Design Principles on #freeCodeCamp, and 
3. Started to use the pomodoro technique to time my work and break sessions using [pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io/)

**Thoughts:** It feels like I am going too quickly through the FCC challenges for HTML and CSS. I am therefore going to complete the CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid on days 4(5) and 5(6), and then go back and read over the material again and add important information to some Anki slide decks. Once I have done this, I will read through [Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS](https://www.packtpub.com/product/responsive-web-design-with-html5-and-css-third-edition/9781839211560) (completing any exercises therein) before going on to complete the HTML and CSS Responsive Web Design Projects.

**TODO:**
1. Complete FCC CSS Flexbox

**TODONE:** 
1. Bought a subscription at Packt Press for access to books and videos on web development. :heavy_check_mark:
