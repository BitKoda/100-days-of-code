### Day 17(18): January 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**
1. Watched last 2 episodes of Wes Bos's CSS Grid course.

**Thoughts** Feeling much more optimistic about being able to tackle the RWD Ch2 exercise. It'll still be a challenge I think - particularly the sloping top and bottom of the black box in the centre of the page, but could I use an SVG image for that?...

**TODO**
1. Have another crack at the RWD Ch2 exercise!
---
### Day 16(17): January 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**
1. Watched Ep 20 - 23 of Wes Bos's CSS Grid course.

**Thoughts** Hmmm. for the layout needed in the RWD Ch2 exercise, might have to use Flexbox for the centred 2 column section of the page...

**TODO**
1. Finish watching Ep 24 & 25 of the CSS Grid video course.
---
### Day 15(16): January 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**
1. Watched Ep 1 - 19 of Wes Bos's CSS Grid course.

**Thoughts** Wishing I'd started to watch this before attempting to tackle the RWD Ch2 exercise! Starting to finally grok CSS Grid!

**TODO**
1. Finish watching ep 20 - 25 of the CSS Grid video course.

### Day 14(15): January 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
1. Zilch
2. Reorganised this log file to descending date order (newest entry first).

**Thoughts:** Struggled again with CSS layout (perhaps unsurprisingly, since I don't know it very well yet). Bit of a let down then today, day 14(15) of #100DaysOfCode It'll be a brighter day tomorrow!

**TODO:**
1. Finalise V1 of RWD page (still!).
---
### Day 13(14): January 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
1. Version 1 of RWD page exercise from Chapter 2 nearly complete.
2. Sorted the slight quirk with the width of on elements.

**Thoughts:** Progress at last - starting to get the hang of things!

**TODO:**
1. Finalise V1 of RWD page.
---
### Day 12(13): January 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
1. So the idea kind of works. Finally worked out how to layout the page for the C2 exercise in RWD book using CSS Grid (almost)
2. Worked out the grid layout for exercise - well almost. Slight quirk with the width of on elements...

**Thoughts:** Perhaps I'm just an impatient reader, but I have struggled to find really good, well explained tutorials on flexbox and CSS grid for a beginner. This could make a good Medium article!!!

**TODO:**
1. Get chapter 2 exercise layout finished
---
### Day 11(12): January 12, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
1. Read some articles on Flexbox
2. Hacked and slashed at various ways to try and bend css grid/flexbox to my will. Unsuccessfully.
3. Completed CSS tooltip

**Thoughts:** Going around in circles a bit. Then, as I go to bed an idea occurs to me...must try it out tomorrow. 

**TODO:**
1. Sort grid layout for C2 exercise page
---
### Day 10(11): January 11, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
1. Continued to code up C2 exercsie in [RWD](https://bit.ly/2MJqUOM)

**Thoughts:** This exercise is still taking much longer than anticipated! CSS nav tooltip completed and that's about it! 

**TODO:**
1. Finish chapter 2 exercise
---
### Day 9(10): January 10, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
1. Started to code up C2 exercsie in [RWD](https://bit.ly/2MJqUOM)

**Thoughts:** This exercise has taken much longer than anticipated! So far I have only got the logo and main nav links in place. There's still some way to go. 

**TODO:**
1. Finish chapter 2 exercise
---
### Day 8(9): January 09, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
1. Read and coded along and finished C2 of [RWD](https://bit.ly/2MJqUOM) -- apart from the final exercise!

**Thoughts:** Only managed an hour today (2 pomodoros). Made quite a few notes on this topic though. Mostly reading, almost no coding - again! Also struggled to get the mp4 video to work in Firefox on Ununtu. Need to get that working soon! 

**TODO:**
1. Finish chapter 2 exercise
---
### Day 7(8): January 08, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
1. Read (and coded along) [RWD](https://bit.ly/2MJqUOM) by @benfrain to Chapter 2.4 New semantic elements in HTML5 section in Chapter 2.

**Thoughts:** Only managed an hour today (2 pomodoros). Made quite a few notes on this topic though. Mostly reading, almost no coding. 

**TODO:**
1. Revise all FCC HTML and CSS challenges
2. Finish chapter 2 of book.
---
### Day 6(7): January 07, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
1. Read (and coded along) [RWD](https://bit.ly/2MJqUOM) by @benfrain to chapter 1 and (a third of) chapter 2.

**Thoughts:** This was definitely more of a challenge than Flexbox. Some revision required here! Getting used to the syntax will take a little time. 

**TODO:**
1. Revise all FCC HTML and CSS challenges
2. Finish chapter 2 of book.
---
### Day 5(6): January 06, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
1. Finished FCC CSS Grid challenges!

**Thoughts:** This was definitely more of a challenge than Flexbox. Some revision required here! Getting used to the syntax will take a little time. 

**TODO:**
1. Revise all FCC HTML and CSS challenges
2. Start reading [Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS](https://www.packtpub.com/product/responsive-web-design-with-html5-and-css-third-edition/9781839211560)
---
### Day 4(5): January 05, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
1. Finished FCC CSS Flexbox challenges!

**Thoughts:** Although the exercises were simple to follow, thanks to step-by-step instructions, the concept of flexbox will take much more to fully understand it and embed into my brain. Looking forward to starting (maybe even completing) the CSS Grid challenges tomorrow and then it will be time to go back and review, write anki decks before moving on to the HTML/CSS book. Only once I have done this will I feel able to tackle the HTML and CSS projects on FCC. 

**TODO:**
1. Complete FCC CSS Grid
---
### Day 3(4): January 04, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
1. Finished Applied Accessibility, and 
2. Responsive Design Principles on #freeCodeCamp, and 
3. Started to use the pomodoro technique to time my work and break sessions using [pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io/)
4. Bought a subscription at Packt Press for access to books and videos on web development. :heavy_check_mark:

**Thoughts:** It feels like I am going too quickly through the FCC challenges for HTML and CSS. I am therefore going to complete the CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid on days 4(5) and 5(6), and then go back and read over the material again and add important information to some Anki slide decks. Once I have done this, I will read through [Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS](https://www.packtpub.com/product/responsive-web-design-with-html5-and-css-third-edition/9781839211560) (completing any exercises therein) before going on to complete the HTML and CSS Responsive Web Design Projects.

**TODO:**
1. Complete FCC CSS Flexbox
---
### Day 2(3): January 03, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
1. Completed the Applied Visual Design FreeCodeCamp challenges!

**Thoughts:** As per yesterday - must create those Anki cards and get a good book on both HTML and CSS. I'm thinking of [Responsive Web Design with HTML5 and CSS - Third Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/product/responsive-web-design-with-html5-and-css-third-edition/9781839211560). 

**TODO:** 
1. Purchase a book on HTML and CSS (or a video course?) 
---
### Day 1(2): January 02, 2021

**Today's Progress**:
1. Completed the Basic CSS FreeCodeCamp challenges!

**Thoughts:** To make some of the more advanced CSS styling concepts stick I need to create some Anki cards and take a deeper dive into both HTML and CSS.

**TODO:** 
1. Purchase a book on HTML and CSS, maybe [Head First HTML and CSS](https://amzn.to/2X2UJf1) as recommended by [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs)? Published in 2012, could this be out of date?
---
