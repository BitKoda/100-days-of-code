# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 01, 2021

**Today's Progress**:

1. Set up a Medium account (@8-bit-koda) to write about my coding experiences
2. Set up a Twitter account (@8_koda) to make my commitment to the 100daysofcode challenge public
3. Set up this Github account to keep all of my code
4. Got a FreeCodeCamp account to start the journey
5. Completed the Basic HTML and HTML5 challenges!

**Thoughts:** Github has changed since I last used it! Excited to begin this journey into a new career.
